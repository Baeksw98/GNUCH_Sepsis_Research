## Background

This study evaluates the predictive power of various laboratory biomarkers in diagnosing bacteremia among septic ICU patients, aiming to optimize a predictive model for bacteremia identification. Few studies have investigated the diagnostic utilities of biomarkers for predicting bacteremia in ICU-admitted septic patients, leading to this study's exploration of high-performance markers.

## Methods

A retrospective cross-sectional study at Gyeongsang National University Changwon Hospital in 2019 involved adult septic patients who met SEPSIS-3 criteria and had undergone blood culture tests. This study built a multivariable logistic regression (MLR) model using identified significant predictors.

## Results

The study analyzed 218 patients, including 48 true bacteremia cases. Notable biomarkers like CRP and PCT were utilized to develop an MLR model with high predictive accuracy for bacteremia.

## Conclusions

While PCT alone is a useful indicator, combining it with other biomarkers like bilirubin, NLR, and others significantly improves bacteremia prediction accuracy.
